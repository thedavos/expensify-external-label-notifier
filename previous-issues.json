User attempts to navigate and perform actions within a workspace in New Expensify\n2. User switches to Expensify Classic, where no restriction is present\n3. User switches back to New Expensify, and the restriction message persists\n\n## Expected Result:\nThe user should be able to navigate and perform actions normally in the workspace.\nWorkspace restriction status should be consistent between Classic and New Expensify.\n## Actual Result:\nUser sees the error message:\n“Actions on the [workspace name] workspace are currently restricted. Please reach out to your workspace admin with any questions.”\nWorkspace actions are blocked only in New Expensify.\n## Workaround:\nCan the user still use Expensify without this being fixed?

In Expensify Classic, configure a custom export column to use the formula:{expense:posted:M/dd/yyyy}\n2. Save this format as Expense Report Review export\n3. In New Expensify (NewDot), go to the Reports page\n4. Select several expenses in a report that should have a Posted Date\n5. Click on the dropdown of the bulk select\n6. Click Export to → Expense Report Review using the custom format\n7. Open the resulting CSV file\n## Expected Result:\nThe Posted Date column (e.g., Column A) is populated for all applicable expenses/reports, matching the behavior when exporting the same data and format from Expensify Classic.\n## Actual Result:\nIn the CSV exported from New Expensify, most of Column A (the Posted Date column) is blank or missing values.\nExporting the same reports using the same custom export in Expensify Classic populates the Posted Date correctly without any issues.\n## Workaround:\nCan the user still use Expensify without this being fixed? Have you informed them of the workaround?\n\n## Platforms:\nSelect the officially supported platforms where the issue was reproduced:\n- [ ] Android: App\n- [ ] Android: mWeb Chrome\n- [ ] iOS: App\n- [ ] iOS: mWeb Safari\n- [ ] iOS: mWeb Chrome\n- [x] Windows: Chrome\n- [x] MacOS: Chrome / Safari\n\n## Screenshots/Videos\n\nThe screenshot for the issue is in Slack [thread](https://expensify.slack.com/archives/C049HHMV9SM/p1770076977759929)\n\n[View all open jobs on GitHub](https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Help+Wanted%22)\n\n\n<details><summary>Issue Owner</summary>Current Issue Owner: @abdulrahuman5196</details>",

    "body": "We have a very powerful set of accounting workflows that we enable in the app, though using these sections requires knowing how to use advanced social filters. Once we explain the functionality to users, they're blown away by the functionality. So to lower the barrier to using and understanding these features, we're going to split each accounting workflow into it's own section. \n\nThe structure and logic works like this. \n\n**1. Card statements**\n------\n - This was previously called `Statements` within the accounting section. \n - Within this section, we'll have sub-options for each card feed that appears in the `Feed` filter. So for example, if the feed name is \"ExpensiCorp Visa\" then that's what appears. \n\nAn example to hopefully make this more clear:\n - Card statements\n   - ExpensiCorp Visa\n   - American Express \n   - Bank of America\n\nThe benefit of this change is that it's easy to see and toggle between card feeds, even if you're not an expert in filters. \n\n**2. Unapproved accruals**\n------\n - This was previously called \"Unapproved cash\" and \"Unapproved card\"\n - Within this section, we'll have sub-options for \"Cash\" and then one for each card feed feed.\n\nAn example to hopefully make this more clear:\n - Unapproved accruals\n   - Cash   \n   - ExpensiCorp Visa\n   - American Express\n\nThe benefit of this change is similar. Now it's easy to switch between the main cases in the LHN, falling back on the advanced filters only if needed. \n\n**3. Bank reconciliation**\n------\n - The was previously called \"Reconciliation\" \n - Within this section, we'll have sub-options for \"Reimbursements\" and \"Expensify Card\" (depending on which case exists. \n\nAn example of hopefully make this more clear:\n - Bank reconciliation\n   - Reimbursements\n   - Expensify Card\n<details><summary>Upwork Automation - Do Not Edit</summary>\n    <ul>\n        <li>Upwork Job URL: https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~022018653420921934684</li>\n        <li>Upwork Job ID: 2018653420921934684</li>\n        <li>Last Price Increase: 2026-02-03</li>\n    </ul>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Issue Owner</summary>Current Issue Owner: @jjcoffee</details>",

    "body": "## Problem\n\nAttachments and images load very slowly when viewing them in the app, with reports of nearly a minute to load a single low-resolution image even on fast internet connections.\n\n### Observations\n- On mobile (iOS), loading a single attachment can take ~1 minute for a low-res image\n- Web loads faster than mobile, but still slower than expected for a responsive application\n- User's internet is fast and everything else loads fine\n- The issue is reproducible and was observed by multiple team members during Onshore\n\n## Suspected Cause\n\nThe attachment carousel feature may be preloading all images in the chat to enable the `<` and `>` navigation arrows. For chats with many attachments, this means:\n1. Opening one image triggers loading of potentially dozens/hundreds of other images\n2. This causes significant delays before the requested image is visible\n3. Large/active chats are disproportionately affected\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n- The selected attachment should load within 1-2 seconds on a decent internet connection\n- If carousel preloading is needed, it should happen lazily/progressively after the primary image is loaded\n- Adjacent images (prev/next) could be prioritized over distant ones\n\n## Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Open a chat with many attachments/images\n2. Tap on an attachment to view it in the full-screen viewer\n3. Observe the loading spinner duration\n\n## Platform\n\n- [x] iOS (primary report)\n- [ ] Android (needs verification)\n- [x] Web (also affected but less severe)\n\n## Related Discussion\n\nSlack thread: https://expensify.slack.com/archives/C05LX9D6E07/p1770083248855669\n\n## Possible Solutions\n\n1. **Lazy carousel loading**: Only preload adjacent images (N-1, N+1) initially, then progressively load others\n2. **Show image immediately**: Display the requested image first, then load carousel images in background\n3. **Thumbnail fallback**: Show low-res thumbnails for carousel navigation while full-res images load on demand\n4. **Limit preload count**: Cap the number of images preloaded for the carousel\n<details><summary>Upwork Automation - Do Not Edit</summary>\n    <ul>\n        <li>Upwork Job URL: https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~022018561992008864454</li>\n        <li>Upwork Job ID: 2018561992008864454</li>\n        <li>Last Price Increase: 2026-02-03</li>\n    </ul>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Issue Owner</summary>Current Issue Owner: @abzokhattab</details>",
