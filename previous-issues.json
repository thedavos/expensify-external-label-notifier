Log into the Expensify web app (NewDot).\n2. Navigate to Reports → Pay.\n3. Open an Approved expense report that does not require reimbursement (e.g., card-only or company-paid expenses).\n4. Click the Pay button on the report.\n\n## Expected Result:\nThe user should be able to select Mark as Paid  (like in Classic) to manually close the report, even when no reimbursement payout is required, in order to signal that the report has been fully reviewed, reconciled, and exported to the accounting system.\n## Actual Result:\nThe Mark as Paid option is disabled/greyed out unless the report has an active reimbursement payout. Admins cannot manually mark non-reimbursable reports as paid or closed.\n(Mark as paid button not displayed in NewDot staging and Reimburse button displayed in OldDot)\n## Workaround:\nUnknown\n## Platforms:\nSelect the officially supported platforms where the issue was reproduced:\n- [ ] Android: App\n- [ ] Android: mWeb Chrome\n- [ ] iOS: App\n- [ ] iOS: mWeb Safari\n- [ ] iOS: mWeb Chrome\n- [x] Windows: Chrome\n- [ ] MacOS: Chrome / Safari\n\n## Screenshots/Videos\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cdf249d-b894-4fd8-a327-16cbf835f64a\n\n[View all open jobs on GitHub](https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Help+Wanted%22)\n\n<details><summary>Upwork Automation - Do Not Edit</summary>\n    <ul>\n        <li>Upwork Job URL: https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~022019451850427008208</li>\n        <li>Upwork Job ID: 2019451850427008208</li>\n        <li>Last Price Increase: 2026-02-05</li>\n    </ul>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Issue Owner</summary>Current Issue Owner: @jayeshmangwani</details>",

    "body": "We're seeing that customers are confused how to add date ranges using the UI search filters. This is possible via the existing `Before` and `After` filters, though on Classic the UX is a bit more clear since you can see the both ranges visually at the same time. \n\nBased on discussion in Slack, let's add a `Range` option within the existing date filters, as this makes filtering on date ranges more obvious. The changes are:\n\n - Add a `Range` option to all date based filters\n - `Range` will appear as the bottom-most option\n\n<img width=\"750\" height=\"986\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9363f5ea-2928-40f9-b2b6-70b379b65c3b\" />\n\n - The date filters where this applies are `Date`, `Approved`, `Paid`, `Submitted`, `Withdrawn`, `Posted`, `Exported` (let me know if I missed any). \n - A user is required to select at least two dates. If they select one, we'll show a standard form error.\n<img width=\"1392\" height=\"996\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e54f70d4-b4e5-4034-b3b9-431168a01bac\" />\n\n**Mobile examples**\n\n<img width=\"2410\" height=\"1624\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be30dc4f-5ce3-49e6-9803-13864dbd8dbe\" />\n\n**Desktop examples**\n\n<img width=\"2800\" height=\"1624\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4750623b-ecbe-43a3-911f-46bf0486e6d3\" />\n\n<img width=\"2800\" height=\"1624\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70c9fbaa-73cf-40c5-8b38-fca4f58e3e6f\" />\n\n<img width=\"2800\" height=\"1624\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6cb7313-230a-4758-a993-38633d7d0bca\" />\n<details><summary>Upwork Automation - Do Not Edit</summary>\n    <ul>\n        <li>Upwork Job URL: https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~022019346980670781751</li>\n        <li>Upwork Job ID: 2019346980670781751</li>\n        <li>Last Price Increase: 2026-02-05</li>\n    </ul>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Issue Owner</summary>Current Issue Owner: @Pujan92</details>",
