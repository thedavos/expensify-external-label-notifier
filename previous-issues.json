Use an account that already has some good amount of data\n2. Go to Reports tab\n3. Go to Workspaces\n\n## Expected Result:\nDescribe what you think should've happened\n\nThe icons and avatars should render immediately, but they take longer to show.\n\nOn poor connection this can also be seen.\n\n## Actual Result:\nDescribe what actually happened\n\nSometimes they can be missing (take longer to show), especially when going between the bottom tabs, the avatars in the LHN in inbox or icons in the workspaces tab, or icons elsewhere, it does not seem to be specific to just some part of the app.\n\nThis leads to poor UX\n\nIt looks like the lazyloading is being triggered when it should not be, we can see icons that been already loaded missing and rendering with delay. cc @OlimpiaZurek @mollfpr \n\n## Workaround:\nCan the user still use Expensify without this being fixed?
